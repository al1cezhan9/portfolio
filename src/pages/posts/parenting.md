<!-- # Odd Parallels -->

<!-- I think a lot about parenting. Probably an above average amount for someone of my stature. I think it all comes down to the complexity of power imbalance and information asymmetry that are so core to the process, and how the very same ideas dominate many other modern debates. 

The most obvious manifestation of parenting philosophies holding significance outside of parenting is the parallel in government. The government is all of our parents.<br> 
Laws = Rules<br>
Taxes = Chores<br>
Benefits = Allowance<br>
Jail = Grounding<br>
Emigration = Estrangment (?)<br>
The analagy falls apart as you dig a little deeper, but the gist remains. 

How much should parents listen to their children's (often misinformed) input?<br>
How much should governments listen to citizens' (often misinformed) input?<br>
When is consent a prerequisite, and when is it just a suggestion?<br>
To what extent is transparency required vs. extraneous?<br>

The debate between technocracy and democracy somewhat organically follows from this. 

I always thought parenting books were silly. Having never read one myself, I took it upon myself to investigate. To my knowledge there are 4 main prominent philosophies: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved. 

I don't think uninvolved parents are the ones reading the books written by proponents of uninvolved parenting (now that I think about it, I wonder whether an audience for these titles even exists). 

Regardless, I strongly believe in intellectual consistency. Don't mind the *tu quoque* fallacious thinking here, but the logical soundness of one's opinions as a sound universal set rather than a union of individually sound partitions is important to me. This integrity constraint means that if your opinion on one thing changes, it should trigger re-assessment of all other beliefs you have. 

Vaccines contain traces of the virus they aim to prevent. I think parenting should serve the same purpose.
