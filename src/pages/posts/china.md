I've never read an article about China not written in English. I suppose this seems quite obvious if you take into account the fact that my Mandarin abilities don't extend far past the bare minimum required to order at restaurants. But, more troubling is that I'd argue those producing works on China in English tend to be quite misinformed. Even oddly copious number of American foodie expats who frequent the Xi'an streets on Youtube are engaging in some sort of cultual immersion. I often think about the way that Western media portrays the Chinese social credit system as a prime example of misinterpretation. Enough talk about the prominence of government-sanctioned propaganda in China, when are we acknowledging the prevalence of Western-media-sanctioned propaganda regarding China.  

Takeaway #1
Freedom isn't one-dimensional. Freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms, freedom of press aren't the only valid manifestations of personal freedom. For many, the freedom in mobility that high speed trains offer, the freedom to complain alongside strangers on the street, the freedom to order an umbrella delivered in 5 minutes for <1USD when you're caught in torrential downpour, the freedom to haggle for your groceries. 

I often think back to one observation Dan Wang (author of Breakneck) makes: America is run by lawyers, whereas China is run by engineers. The one-child policy lasting from 1979 to 2015 is one example of of China's engineering-forward mentality going wrong (sex-selective abortions, human trafficking, and infanticide).
