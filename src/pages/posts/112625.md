# Beginnings

... and how I feel about them...

Published on: 2025-11-26

## How this works

1. **Thinking**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Timing**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Revisiting**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
